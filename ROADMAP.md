- [ ] P3 — Evaluate a bundled rule-based offline proofreader
  Why: Gboard's on-device writing tools are gated to Gemini-Nano-class hardware and the Grammarly keyboard is being discontinued, leaving grammar assistance unavailable to everyone on ordinary devices. A rule-and-dictionary proofreader is the one credible offline answer that fits `minSdk 26` and needs no model runtime — and SwiftFloris already has the surfaces (spell-checker service, smartbar candidates, `SensitiveFieldGuard`, the addon contract) to host it without touching the base APK's no-network posture.
  Evidence: `ime/nlp/SpellingResult.kt:52-58,116` already carries the Android 12+ grammar-error attribute but nothing produces one; `ime/smartcompose/SensitiveFieldGuard.kt`; `AddonContract` already defines `SMART_COMPOSE_RUNTIME`; https://github.com/futo-org/android-keyboard/issues/2217 ; https://support.google.com/gboard/answer/16515540 ; https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/articles/25038364027661--The-Grammarly-Keyboard-for-Android-will-be-discontinued
  Touches: `ime/nlp/SpellingResult.kt`, `FlorisSpellCheckerService.kt`, `ime/smartcompose/`, `addons/`, `docs/PRIVACY_AND_AI.md`
  Acceptance: a written evaluation covering licence compatibility with Apache-2.0, per-language rule-data size, and APK-vs-addon packaging, plus a spike proving one English rule set produces `RESULT_ATTR_LOOKS_LIKE_GRAMMAR_ERROR` results through the existing spell-checker service on the attached device. Ship the decision, not the integration, in this item. Distinct from the blocked transformer-prediction addon: no model runtime, no GPU, no `INTERNET`.
  Complexity: L
